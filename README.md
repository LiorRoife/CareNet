Project Summary:
The project aims to address the absence of a responsible organization for boycotting events, which has led to an alarming increase in child suicides, a previously uncommon phenomenon. To combat this, we are developing an anonymous and welcoming online platform where children, parents, and individuals can report boycotts and seek assistance. Through a chat feature, users will choose options like "I'm being boycotted" or "I know somebody being boycotted," providing necessary information. Simultaneously, the platform will offer immediate support while sending detailed messages to designated school personnel who can intervene and request more information. Our goal is to create a secure and supportive space that attracts individuals, floods information, and provides crucial aid to children facing boycotts.
